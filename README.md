freezetag
=========

About
-----

`freezetag` is a tool that saves, strips, and restores file paths and music metadata. This metadata is written to a
freezetag file (usually just a few kB) that can transform downloaded music files between different filename/tag states.

Use cases:
1. Freezetags can be generated after a torrent finishes downloading to [freeze](#freeze) the directory state. Later,
   even after moving, retagging, and renaming those files, the original downloaded state can be restored
   ([thawed](#thaw)).

2. Additionally, these freezetags can be [mounted](#mount), allowing retagged music to coexist with the original
   downloaded music files without taking up extra disk space. This means you can retag your music and continue to seed
   in your torrent client from the same set of files. _Have your cake and eat it too!_

3. In the same vein, users can seed torrents between different trackers with just one copy of the music files, even if
   the music has been retagged and renamed between trackers.

4. Freezetags can also be generated for an entire music library *after* the music has been retagged to [back up](#--backup)
   your personal tags. These quick incremental backups will archive your tags and filenames, which can later be restored
   from the original torrents.

Requirements
------------

`freezetag` requires Python 3.5.2 or greater (older versions may technically work, but are untested).

A FUSE implementation must also be installed to use [`freezetag mount`](#mount):
* Windows users can install [WinFsp](https://github.com/billziss-gh/winfsp/releases/latest).
* Mac users can install FUSE for macOS via `brew cask install osxfuse` or
  [manually](https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/releases/latest).
* Linux users can install `fuse2` from their package managers or
  [manually](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse/releases/tag/fuse-2.9.9).

Installation
------------

    $> pip install git+https://github.com/x1ppy/freezetag

Supported Formats
-----------------

Currently, FLAC and MP3 formats are supported. Vorbis comments are supported for FLAC files, and ID3 tags are supported
for MP3 files.

Note that metadata will be frozen/thawed/shaved for supported music and metadata formats only.

Examples
--------

### `freeze`

Create a freezetag that stores paths and metadata for all files in this directory, saving the freezetag to a file
named F**a**-**b**-**c**.ftag (as described in [Freezetag ID](#freezetag-id)) to this directory:

    $> freezetag freeze

Same as above, except `downloads/Pink Floyd - Dark Side of the Moon (1973 MSFL UDCD 517) - FLAC` is used instead of the
current directory:

    $> freezetag freeze "downloads/Pink Floyd - Dark Side of the Moon (1973 MSFL UDCD 517) - FLAC"

If `--ftag` is passed, the freezetag will be written to that directory instead of the directory being frozen:

    $> freezetag freeze --ftag ~/ftags

Or, if the `--ftag` argument is a file, the freezetag will be explicitly named (`redacted-pink-floyd-the-wall.ftag` in
this case):

    $> freezetag freeze --ftag ~/ftags/redacted-pink-floyd-the-wall.ftag

These examples all freeze a single album's state. With the default usage, it's recommended that each album has its own
freezetag, as shown here. This way, other directories under `downloads` can be added/changed/removed without affecting
the freezetag corresponding to each individual download.

Freezetags are unique for a given group of files with the same metadata, so album-level freezetags can be shared among
users to recreate the exact torrent download state. In fact, if two users independently create freezetags for the same
downloaded directory, the freezetags (and their IDs) will be identical. In theory, trackers could even provide
freezetags alongside download links that match the given releases, and freezetag IDs could be an API-queryable
alternative to torrent info hashes.

#### `--backup`

`freezetag freeze` also includes an incremental backup mode, enabled with the `--backup` flag:

    $> freezetag freeze ~/music --backup

This mode is intended to be used on your top-level music directory, and allows you to export all of your personal tags.
`freezetag thaw` can later be used on the original torrent downloads in your `~/downloads` directory to fully recreate
your personal tagged library.

Unlike the default mode, backup mode writes last modified dates and file sizes to the freezetag. This enables
incremental backups, meaning that the original `freezetag freeze --backup` of your library can take awhile (minutes to
hours depending on the size of your library), but subsequent `freezetag freeze --backup`s can complete in mere seconds.
Only the most recent freezetag will be read for an incremental backup, and if the library is unchanged since the last
backup, a new freezetag will not be created.

Backup freezetags follow a different naming scheme, and will be named F**yyyy**-**MM**-**dd**\_**hh**-**mm**-**ss**.ftag
using the date of creation.

### `thaw`

Restore files in-place in the current directory to the freezetag state, using whatever freezetag is in the current
directory (prompting the user if multiple `.ftag`s exist):

    $> freezetag thaw

Same as above, except `downloads/Pink Floyd - Dark Side of the Moon (1973 MSFL UDCD 517) - FLAC` is used instead of the
current directory:

    $> freezetag thaw "downloads/Pink Floyd - Dark Side of the Moon (1973 MSFL UDCD 517) - FLAC"

For parity with `freeze`, `thaw` supports an `--ftag` flag that searches the given directory for a freezetag instead:

    $> freezetag thaw --ftag ~/ftags

Or, if a freezetag is explicitly passed with `--ftag`, that freezetag will be used to thaw. The following thaws files
in-place in the current directory using the given freezetag:
   
    $> freezetag thaw --ftag ~/ftags/redacted-pink-floyd-the-wall.ftag

By default, `thaw` will thaw files in-place, meaning files and directories will be moved/modified/created to match the
freezetag state. If the `--to` flag is passed, no files will be modified, but will instead be copied and thawed to the
given directory:

    $> freezetag thaw --to ~/out

The thawed files will be written to a subdirectory named according to the `root` directory from the freezetag. The
`root` is the name of the top directory when the files were frozen. So if we freeze a directory and thaw it with `--to`:

    $> cd "downloads/Pink Floyd - Dark Side of the Moon (1973 MSFL UDCD 517) - FLAC"
    $> freezetag freeze
    $> freezetag thaw --to ~/out

This will restore the freezetag state to `~/out/Pink Floyd - Dark Side of the Moon (1973 MSFL UDCD 517) - FLAC`.

As another example, say we regularly make backups of our music library state:

    $> freezetag freeze ~/music --backup --ftag ~/ftags

We could then recover this backed-up state from a directory of downloaded music:

    $> freezetag thaw ~/downloads --to ~ --ftag ~/ftags

This will restore our library from `~/downloads` to `~/music`, keeping `~/downloads` intact.

### `mount`

Recursively mount music files and freezetags in `~/music` to `~/freezefs`:

    $> freezetag mount ~/music ~/freezefs

Music files in `~/music` will appear under `~/freezefs` in their original frozen states (paths and tags) from
corresponding freezetag files found under `~/music`. A file in `~/music` will *not* be mapped to`~/freezefs` if there is
no freezetag matching that file. On the other hand, a file in `~/music` can be mapped to `~/freezefs` multiple times
under different paths (and possibly with different tags) if there are multiple freezetags referring to that same file.

`freezetag mount` enables renamed/retagged music to be seeded without requiring copies on disk. For example, let's say
we download a torrent to `~/downloads/Pink Floyd - Dark Side of the Moon (1973 MSFL UDCD 517) - FLAC`. Assuming our
personal tagged library is stored under `~/music` and mounted as shown above, we can then:
1. Run `freezetag freeze `~/downloads/Pink Floyd - Dark Side of the Moon (1973 MSFL UDCD 517) - FLAC` after the torrent
   finishes.
2. Retag/rename/move the files (e.g., to `~/music/Pink Floyd/Dark Side of the Moon`). Assuming we also move the
   freezetag from step 1 along with it, this will automatically make a new `Pink Floyd - Dark Side of the Moon (1973
   MSFL UDCD 517) - FLAC` directory appear under our mount point (`~/freezefs`).
3. Point our torrent client to seed the files from `~/freezefs/Pink Floyd - Dark Side of the Moon (1973 MSFL UDCD 517) -
   FLAC`.

Ideally, the above steps would be automated by your torrent client/music importer.

Mounts are read-only. Mounts are "live", meaning new files added to the source directory will automatically appear under
the mount point (assuming there's a matching freezetag), and deleted files will automatically disappear. Similarly,
changes in tags or freezetag files will be reflected automatically.

A custom location or path may be specified for the database via --db-path. The default location is the local user's
cache dir. For example, on Debian this would be $HOME/.cache/freezetag/freezefs.db. If a custom folder is specified
the default name of freezefs.db will still be used. If a custom filename is specified, that will be used.

Note: The initial mount may take awhile depending on how large your library is. Mount metadata is cached on disk, so
subsequent mounts should activate in just a few seconds.

### `shave`

Strips all metadata from music files in the current directory:

    $> freezetag shave

Same as above, except `downloads/Pink Floyd - Dark Side of the Moon (1973 MSFL UDCD 517) - FLAC` is used instead of the
current directory:

    $> freezetag shave  "downloads/Pink Floyd - Dark Side of the Moon (1973 MSFL UDCD 517) - FLAC"

`freezetag shave` can be useful if you want to share the "bare" music files. This has the advantage of smaller overall
distribution size (especially if the music contains images), and it allows tags to be shared separately. That is, users
can create and distribute different freezetag files using the same bare music files, and the bare music files will
remain unchanged.

### `show`

Shows the contents of a freezetag file.

    $> freezetag show
    version: 1
    mode:    default
    id:      Fc58e43e83c0487f5-56ddb165-e8a1171b

You can also use the `--json` flag to get parse-friendly output:

    $> freezetag show --json
    {
      "version": 1,
      "mode": "default",
      "id": "Fc58e43e83c0487f5-56ddb165-e8a1171b",
      "root": "Pink Floyd - Dark Side of the Moon (1973 MSFL UDCD 517) - FLAC",
      "files": [
        {
          "path": "01 - Speak To Me.flac",
          "checksum": "96f5c1b465b263d5090deae5d177df47f0f36efa"
        },
        {
          "path": "02 - Breathe.flac",
          "checksum": "dbd1dc0c8ad514d9641919bc52c99010f5cf3ad2"
        },
        {
          "path": "03 - On The Run.flac",
          "checksum": "65cbc81d99b7ed68125b1652819e5fbec7e7a845"
        },
        ...
      ]
    }

Freezetag ID
------------

By default, the freezetag file will be saved to the processed directory as F**a**-**b**-**c**.ftag, where:
* **a** is a 16-character hex string that uniquely identifies the music
* **b** is an 8-character hex string that uniquely identifies the metadata
* **c** is an 8-character hex string that uniquely identifies the freezetag

While this naming scheme might seem unusual, the uniqueness property lets you quickly see whether two freezetags are
identical simply by comparing their file names:

* The **a** and **b** segments do not change between freezes if any paths change or if any non-music files are modified.
Additionally, the **a** segment doesn't change if the music files are retagged.

* This means if two different .ftag files have the same **a** segment, they represent the same set of raw music. If they
have both the same **a** and **b** segments, they represent the same set of raw music *and* their metadata.

* If all three segments are the same, the two freezetag files are identical. Therefore, running `freezetag freeze` twice
will only result in a single freezetag file being created: since the ID will stay the same, the existing freezetag file
will be replaced on the second invocation.

If you use a custom naming scheme for your freezetags (by passing `--ftag` to `freeze`), the ID can still be found using
`freezetag show`.
